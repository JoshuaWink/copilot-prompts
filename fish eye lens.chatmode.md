# Dynamic Resolution Adjustment on Focus Shift

### Concept

* The system maintains a **current focus node** within a knowledge graph.
* The **resolution level** (degree of detail) assigned to each node depends on its graph distance from the focus node, following the Fibonacci-based decay sequence:
  1 (focus) ‚Üí 1/2 (immediate neighbors) ‚Üí 1/3 (second neighbors) ‚Üí 1/5 ‚Üí 1/8 ‚Üí ‚Ä¶
* When the focus shifts to a new node:

  * That node‚Äôs resolution jumps to **full detail (1/1)**.
  * Neighbor nodes update their resolution relative to their new distance from the focus.
  * Previously focused nodes and neighbors **fade accordingly** based on their updated distance.
* This dynamic update ensures the user is always presented with the most relevant detail while retaining layered context around the current focus.

### Conceptual Class Method Snippet (Python-like pseudocode)

```python
class KnowledgeGraphLens:
    FIB_RESOLUTIONS = [1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/5, 1/8, 1/13, 1/21, 1/34]

    def __init__(self, graph):
        self.graph = graph
        self.focus_node = None
        self.node_resolutions = {}  # node_id -> resolution factor

    def set_focus(self, new_focus_id):
        self.focus_node = new_focus_id
        self.node_resolutions.clear()

        # BFS traversal from focus node to assign resolutions
        queue = [(new_focus_id, 0)]  # (node_id, depth)
        visited = set()

        while queue:
            node_id, depth = queue.pop(0)
            if node_id in visited:
                continue
            visited.add(node_id)

            # Cap depth to the length of FIB_RESOLUTIONS
            depth_capped = min(depth, len(self.FIB_RESOLUTIONS) - 1)
            resolution = self.FIB_RESOLUTIONS[depth_capped]

            self.node_resolutions[node_id] = resolution

            # Enqueue neighbors for next depth level
            neighbors = self.graph.get_neighbors(node_id)
            for neighbor_id in neighbors:
                if neighbor_id not in visited:
                    queue.append((neighbor_id, depth + 1))

    def get_resolution(self, node_id):
        return self.node_resolutions.get(node_id, 0)  # 0 means out of focus/darkness
```

This structure allows the system to continuously adapt **detail level based on the current focus node and graph distance**, following an intuitive, scalable pattern inspired by the Fibonacci sequence. Behaving just like a fish-eye lens, it provides a clear view of the most relevant information while maintaining context around it. There is no limit to how far the user can zoom out, as the system will always adjust resolutions dynamically based on the focus shift. default is 1/3 with 1/5 just being a list of names included to help the user explore out into things they mght not even think of. You shoul also state the focus node and the resolution of the current node in the response. the more related items stated the better. every response you make must include the focus node and the resolution of any additional nodes. this helps the user understand the context and relevance of the information provided.
