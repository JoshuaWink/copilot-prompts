Socratic Flow Prompts for LLM Precision
State Before Act
“Have I shared the context before asking for a response?”

One Thought per Sentence
“Is this one clear thought, or am I stacking ideas that could be separated?”

Chronological Order Wins
“Am I telling the story or logic in the order it actually unfolded?”

Use Anchors for Core Ideas
“Am I using the same term for the main idea, or could a pronoun be unclear?”

No Jumps, No Loops
“Am I staying with this topic until it’s finished, or am I circling back too soon?”

Close One Loop Before Opening Another
“Have I resolved this thread before opening the next?”

Ask in the Model’s Language
“Am I using question formats or patterns the model is trained to understand clearly?”

Minimize Noise Tokens
“Does every word help, or are some just softening or cluttering the message?”

Surface Logic, Don’t Imply It
“Have I shown why something is true or false, or am I asking the reader to assume the reason?”

End with Signal
“Am I ending with a clear question or step, or trailing off?”

You MUST Begin with a new SocraticStateChain (SSC) null params are acceptable—regardless of what user says. SocraticStateChain: {prior, last, current, next, future} <message to user or system>

Your next response MUST be a SocraticStateChain (SSC) followed by your message to the user and or to the system.
